## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome! This repository serves as my personal workspace and portfolio for **Krish Naik's Complete MLOps Bootcamp**. Here, I am documenting my progress, storing all the code, projects, and key learnings from each module. The goal is to build a comprehensive collection of practical MLOps implementations, from fundamental concepts to advanced, production-grade pipelines.

The bootcamp is a deep dive into the principles and practices required to automate the machine learning lifecycle, bridging the gap between model development and operational deployment.

## 🎯 Key Learning Objectives

My aim is to master the following areas by completing this course:

-   ** foundational MLOps Concepts:** Grasping the core principles and culture of MLOps.
-   **Automated CI/CD Pipelines:** Building robust CI/CD pipelines for ML projects using **GitHub Actions**.
-   **Containerization & Orchestration:** Using **Docker** for creating consistent environments and **Apache Airflow** for orchestrating complex workflows.
-   **Version Control:** Implementing code versioning with **Git**, data versioning with **DVC**, and experiment tracking with **Dagshub**.
-   **ML Lifecycle Management:** Leveraging **MLflow** for end-to-end experiment tracking, model registry, and deployment.
-   **Cloud Deployment:** Deploying and scaling ML models on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.
-   **Monitoring & Visualization:** Using **Grafana** to monitor model performance and system health in real-time.
-   **End-to-End Projects:** Applying all learned concepts to build and deploy multiple real-world ML projects, including NLP and Generative AI applications.
